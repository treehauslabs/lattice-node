# SOTA Blockchain Testing Plan

Comprehensive test plan for lattice-node and Ivy. Inspired by Bitcoin Core (~40 p2p tests), CometBFT (e2e invariant suite), GossipSub (scoring/mesh tests), Ethereum Hive (protocol conformance), Jepsen (distributed systems correctness), and FoundationDB (deterministic simulation).

**Total: ~90 tests across 24 categories. Priority: P0 = catches real bugs / inflation / consensus splits. P1 = security. P2 = correctness / performance.**

Use this as a prompt to implement each section. All network tests use real TCP between nodes on localhost.

---

## Test Infrastructure

Shared helpers (exist in `NetworkIntegrationTests.swift`):
```swift
private func port() -> UInt16
private func makeNode(kp:port:dir:bootstrap:genesis:) async throws -> LatticeNode
private func genesis() -> GenesisConfig  // UInt256.max difficulty = instant mining
private func spec() -> ChainSpec
```

Pattern: boot 2-3 real LatticeNode instances with real Ivy TCP, mine blocks, exercise the flow, verify invariants, stop all nodes.

---

## CATEGORY A: Difficulty Adjustment & Timewarp [P0] (3 tests)

- Repeat with double-spaced timestamps, verify it decreases
- Compare against expected values from spec formula

### A2. testTimewarpAttackPrevention
- Build chain where last block of period N has timestamp = now + 2h (max allowed)

- Feed through block processing
- Verify difficulty does not drop more than the expected max adjustment factor

### A3. testDifficultyNeverDropsToZero
