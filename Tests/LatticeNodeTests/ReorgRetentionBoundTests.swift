/// knob. A reorg deeper than `retentionDepth` cannot have its orphan set
/// correctly identified — we'd walk the retention window worth of old-tip
/// ancestors and still not hit the common ancestor, silently proceeding
/// with a truncated orphan list that corrupts mempool recovery and child-
/// chain rollback.
///
/// These tests pin the two halves of that contract:
///   1. When the fork is shallower than `retentionDepth`, the walk finds
///      the common ancestor and emits the correct orphan set.
///   2. When the fork exceeds `retentionDepth`, `foundCommonAncestor`
///      stays false so the caller refuses recovery (logged ERROR; caller
///      returns rather than acting on partial data).
